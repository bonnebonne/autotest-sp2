\chapter{Development Environment}
The basic purpose for this section is to give a developer all of the necessary 
information to setup their development environment to run, test, and/or develop.

\section{Development IDE and Tools}
Development for this project was done in Qt Creator. The .pro file for the project is included with 
the source code.

In Sprint 2, the Qt Creator environment was dropped.

\section{Source  Control}
The source control used in this project was Github for both Windows and Linux. A developer could connect 
to it by several ways; the first of which is to go to the Github website, where they were included as 
contributors to the repository where the code and documentation was stored. The second was to use either 
Linux or Windows to checkout the repository and use the push and pull functions of git to keep code and 
documentation updated.

\section{Dependencies}
Dependencies for this program include the c standard library and the POSIX API. The program also takes 
advantage of several Linux system calls. Therefore, it is assumed that it will be run in a Linux environment.

\section{Build  Environment}
The program compiles with GCC into a single executable. This can either be done within Qt Creator or by using 
the Makefile provided with the source code. 

\section{Development Machine Setup}
This program is designed to run on a Linux based machine.
It was developed on a machine running Fedora 20.
