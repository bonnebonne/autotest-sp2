\chapter{Release -- Setup -- Deployment}
This section will contain any specific subsection regarding specifics in releasing, 
setup, and/or deployment of the system. 


\section{Deployment Information and Dependencies}
Dependencies for this application include the c standard library and the POSIX API, both used for the
file system access in the test case finding portion of this program. Since it is assumed that it will be run
in a Linux environment, the application also takes advantage of several Linux system calls. Aside from this,
the program does not rely on any other external libraries.



\section{Setup Information}
A makefile will be provided with the application, which can be run using the command 'make' within the 
directory in which the makefile exists.

The project is run by: \\
./tester [-g or -r] $\langle$ directory $\rangle$

The directory is the place where the test files, student programs, and golden source are stored. Student code is in subdirectories, and test files can be placed anywhere. Any test files generated by the program will be stored in the "tests" subdirectory.


\section{System  Versioning Information}
The system will be versioned with each Sprint of the class, incrementing the first decimal.

In addition to this, when a working version of the project was developed, that version was put into a branch with a time stamp. 
Additionally, every time a working bit of code was developed, it was put into the current branch with 
a description of what was currently working.
