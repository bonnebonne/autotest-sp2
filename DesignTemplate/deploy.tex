\chapter{Release -- Setup -- Deployment}
This section contains subsections regarding specifics in releasing, 
setup, and/or deployment of the system. 


\section{Deployment Information and Dependencies}
Dependencies for this application include the c standard library and the POSIX API, both used for the
file system access in the test case finding portion of this program. This application also relies on Gcov and Gprof. Lastly, it relies on many Linux system calls.



\section{Setup Information}
A makefile will be provided with the application, which can be run using the command 'make' within the 
directory in which the makefile exists. To ensure a full rebuild of the system, run "make" with the "-B" argument.

The project is run by: \\
./tester [-g or -r] $\langle$ directory $\rangle$

The directory is the place where the test files, student programs, and golden source are stored. Student code is in subdirectories, and test files can be placed anywhere. Any test files generated by the program will be stored in the "tests" subdirectory.


\section{System  Versioning Information}
The system will be versioned with each Sprint of the class, incrementing the first decimal.

In addition to this, when a working version of the project was developed, that version was put into a branch with a time stamp. 
Additionally, every time a working bit of code was developed, it was put into the current branch with 
a description of what was currently working.
