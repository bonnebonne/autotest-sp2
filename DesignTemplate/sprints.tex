\chapter{Sprint Reports}
\section{Sprint Report \#1}
As the development of this system was planned to be completed in one sprint, this is the final sprint review for the project. 
The review was conducted with the product owner, the technical lead, and the scrum master. \\

\subsection{Code Development}
The following were designed and written by Joseph Lillo:
\begin{description}
\item [TestSuite Class Declaration]- This class provides an interface for compiling and testing c++ programs against given test files.
\item [dirCrawl] - a function used to perform a recursive Directory Crawl \\ \\
\end{description}
The following were designed and written by Daniel Nix:
\begin{description}
\item [compile\_code] - a function used to compile c++ source code based on filename
\item [run\_code]- a function used to run c++ souce with redirected input/output
\item [correct\_answer]- a function used to do diff on answer file and test program output file \\  \\
\end{description}
The following were designed and written by Lisa Woody:
\begin{description}
\item [Software Documentation and formatting] - the final software write up for the project
\item [Log file output functions]-  functions later integrated into other functions upon team review of the program. \\
\end{description}
The following were designed and written by the Obfuscators as a team:
\begin{description}
\item [runTests] - a function used to run a program with input from test files in the testFiles vector
\item [reset]-  a function used to clear member data associated with testing session.
\end{description}




\subsection{Final Product Review}

The final application, having passed the final testing stages, was demonstrated.  \\
\begin{description}
\item [$\bullet$] Has every phase of the project been completed? 
\item Yes, each of the four phases of the project have been completed.
\item [$\bullet$]Have the phases been successfully integrated into the final product?
\item Yes, the phases are completely integrated into the final product.
\item [$\bullet$] Can the application run the client-provided test files without error?
\item Yes, the application compiles and no errors were found.
\item [$\bullet$] Does the final output match the intended and requested output?
\item Yes, the outputted log file matches the requested format.\\

\item Next, the documentation was reviewed. \\

\item [$\bullet$] Has the documentation been completely filled out and reviewed by each team member?
\item Yes, the documentation has been completed and reviewed. 
\item [$\bullet$] Does the product meet the requirements and needs of each user story?
\item Yes, the product fulfills the needs of each user story laid out in the documentation.
\item [$\bullet$] Does the product satisfy the product backlog and is it deemed deliverable by the product owner?
\item Yes, the product owner is deemed complete and deliverable by the product owner.\\

\item The team is happy with this sprint, and feels that next time it will be prepared for the newly learned Agile methodology and documentation style.\\
\end{description}

\section{Sprint Report \#2}
This sprint lasted from 2/21 to 3/22. The members of the Whitespace Cowboys recived the Obfuscator's first sprint code, 
analyzed it, and turned in a report to Dr. Logar conserning the workability and documentation of the given materials. 
One official scrum meeting was held to hold a planning poker and to assign coding tasks. These are were reflected using 
Trello cards. 

Several unofficial meetings were held, the last of which was used to go over what had not yet been 
completed and how the last steps would be taken to tie up the second sprint. During this last meeting, an unofficial 
code review was held concerning the completed functions, and github issues were worked out.

The code for the second sprint was officially completed on 3/23, with several last minute 
revisions made. Documentation was double checked, and the team made an effort to make sure 
the code was well documented and at least similar in coding standard.
