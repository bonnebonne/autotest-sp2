\chapter{System  and Unit Testing}

This section describes the approach taken with regard to system and unit testing. 

\section{Overview}
A file containing test case files and program files was provided by the client.  These
resources were used to test and troubleshoot the code during the development.

\section{Dependencies}
There are no external dependencies or frameworks for the program. Unit testing was carried out individually because the program was written without a predefined framework on which to test. 

\section{Test Setup and Execution}
The test cases and future test case format were provided by the client.  The latter is an important feature,
as one of the requirements of the application is that test cases must be able to be added and removed.
