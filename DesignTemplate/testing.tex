\chapter{System  and Unit Testing}

This section describes the approach taken with regard to system and unit testing. 

\section{Overview}
A file containing test case files and program files was provided by the client.  These
resources were used to test and troubleshoot the code during the development.

\section{Dependencies}
There are no external dependencies or frameworks for the program. Unit testing was carried out individually because the program was written without a predefined framework on which to test. 

\section{Test Setup and Execution}
The test cases listed below were ran against the program to ensure proper functionality.  Edge cases were considered and tested for each individual test as applicable.

\begin{description}
\item [$\bullet$] Program successfully executes given parent directory via command line
\item [$\bullet$] Properly display menu and error-check user input
\item [$\bullet$] Compiles all .cpp files, to include the "golden .cpp"
\item [$\bullet$] Properly crawls through the directory finding .tst files
\item [$\bullet$] Runs student's code and properly tests the testcases
\item [$\bullet$] Generates random numerical (both floats and ints) test cases 
\item [$\bullet$] Runs the generated test cases against the  "golden.cpp" and successfully generates accompanying .ans files
\item [$\bullet$] Generates each individual student's grade file, to include a class summary grade file
